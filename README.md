# <a id="installation"></a>Installation
With the repo cloned to your local environment, run the following command in the terminal prompt:
```bash
$ npm i
```
(*shorthand for* `npm install` )

This will install all the dependencies listed in the project's `package.json` file.

*Alternatively, if you're using* `yarn` *instead of npm, you can run:* 
```bash
$ yarn install
```

# <a id="instructions"></a>Instructions
With the dependencies installed via `npm` or `yarn`, you can fire up the development environment by running the following command in your terminal prompt:
```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```
*With yarn*:
```bash
$ yarn run start:dev
```

This will fire up a local development environment, leveraging the quick up-and-running functionality of [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server "webpack-dev-server"). Functionality will be added sometime in the future for firing up the environment in a production mode.
