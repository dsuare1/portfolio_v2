      <p>Father, husband, and Node.js developer passionate about building testable, scalable software, with a focus on APIs and backend systems.</p>
      <p>Originally from Louisiana, I&apos;ve been a resident of the great city of Austin, TX since mid-2014. I love to travel with my wife, with whom I was lucky enough to live in Madrid, Spain for two years, and I can&apos;t wait to share the world with my daughter.</p>
      <p>I enjoy listening to music and attending live shows, woodworking in my free time, and playing golf. Two fun facts about me: I ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain during the San Fermines festival in 2012 and have performed five wedding ceremonies.</p>
